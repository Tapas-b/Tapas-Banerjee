## Welcome to my website

My name is Tapas Banerjee. i am currently in 10th grade. I am an enthusiastic learner, amateur video game developer and graphic animator, electronic gadgets geek and a budding entrepreneur.

# Game development
I have always loved to play games specially ones with either amazing graphics or great game logic and idea. I had been surfing various game stores for quite a while and found out that games featuring space exploration have been rarely created. Hence, i have taken matters into my own hands and have pldeged to design amazing games that will gain peoples interests in space-science.
